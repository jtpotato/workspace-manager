# Copilot Instructions

- Be concise and clear in code, and avoid complexity. Simplicity is key.
- Test build after code changes.
- Commit after feature completion, summarising all changes concisely.
- Prevent files from being too large; break them down if necessary.

## SwiftUI Specifics

- Prefer SwiftUI where possible.
- Choose SwiftUI idiomatic solutions.
- Ensure views dynamically adapt to content size and system preferences (e.g., light/dark mode).
- Use modifiers like `.frame` sparingly to avoid unnecessary constraints.

## Coding Patterns and Preferences

- Modularize code by splitting large files into smaller, reusable components.
- Extract repetitive logic into private functions or extensions.
- Ensure syntax correctness, especially for Swift-specific constructs like `@Environment` and `ForEach`.
- Keep code simple and avoid complexity.
- Use clear and concise naming conventions for variables, functions, and components.

# Workspace Manager

- SwiftUI app for macOS to manage files, folders, and links in workspaces.
- Users can add items to workspaces, save them, and open them later.
- Focus on user-friendly design and efficient workflow.
- Prioritize visually appealing and functional UI elements.
